<H2 CLASS="clause"><A NAME="clause-4"></A>4 Exchange structure fundamental concepts and assumptions</H2>


<H3><A NAME="clause-4-1"></A>4.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>The exchange structure is described by an unambiguous, context-free
grammar to facilitate parsing by software. The grammar is expressed in
Wirth Syntax Notation that is described in <A HREF="annexB.htm">annex
B</A>. The form of product data in the exchange structure is specified
using a mapping from the EXPRESS language to the exchange structure
syntax. </P>


<H3><A NAME="clause-4-2"></A>4.2 Notational and typographical conventions</H3>

<P>Any <EM>quotation marks</EM> used in this part of ISO 10303 are not
part of the text that appears in the exchange structure but serve to
delimit that text. This statement applies to all places in the text
where <EM>quotation marks</EM> are
used. <A HREF="clause5.htm#table-2">Table 2</A>,
<A HREF="clause5.htm#table-3">Table 3</A>,
and <A HREF="clause6.htm#table-4">Table 4</A> form an exception to
this rule as the <EM>quotation marks</EM> used in those tables form
part of the WSN rules.</P>

<P>In ISO/IEC 8859, each character is assigned an identifying name. When
that name is used in this part of ISO 10303, it is typeset
in <EM>italics</EM> to distinguish it from ordinary
text. Thus <EM>comma</EM> is used to refer to &quot;,&quot;, <EM>low
line</EM> refers to &quot;_&quot;, and <em>latin capital letter A</EM>
refers to &quot;A&quot;.</P>


<P>Within examples in this part of ISO 10303, an annotation is
introduced by the sequence <TT>----&gt;</TT> where clarification is
required.</P>


<H3><A NAME="clause-4-3"></A>4.3 Conformance</H3>

<P>Two levels of conformance are specified:</P>

<UL>
<LI>syntactical conformance of the exchange structure: an exchange
structure conforms to ISO 10303-21 if the requirements of this part of
ISO 10303 are satisfied;</LI>

<LI>schema conformance of the exchange structure: the instances
represented in the exchange structure conform to the schemas listed in
the header section of the exchange structure if every requirement or
constraint of these schemas is satisfied with respect to each instance
or grouping of instances to which it shall apply whatsoever and the
mapping requirements defined in clauses <A href="clause11.htm">11</A>
and <A href="clause12.htm">12</A> of this part of ISO 10303 are
satisfied.</LI>
</UL>


<P CLASS="example">
NOTE 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A HREF="annexE.htm">Annex E</A>
presents methods for evaluating schema conformance when an exchange
structure contains multiple data sections based on different EXPRESS
schemas.</P>

<P>Syntactical conformance is a prerequisite for schema conformance.</P>

<P>Three classes of syntactical conformance are defined by this part of
ISO 10303:
<UL>
<LI>an exchange structure shall be syntactical conformance class 3 if
it defines value instances, if it references EXPRESS constants or if
it defines functionality using ECMAScript;
<LI>otherwise an exchange structure shall be syntactical conformance
class 2 if it has a reference section, or uses a multi-file ZIP
structure;
<LI>otherwise an exchange structure shall be syntactical conformance
class 1.
</UL>

<P CLASS="example">
NOTE 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A processor for a previous
edition of this part of ISO 10303 can parse syntactical conformance
class 1 by ignoring the anchor and signature sections, and it can
parse syntactical conformance class 2 by using a pre-processor to
resolve external entity references in the reference section.</P>

<P CLASS="example">
NOTE 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The syntactical conformance class
of an exchange structure is shown by the implementation_level
attribute of the <b>file_description</b> entity in the header section
(see <A href="clause8.htm#clause-8-2-2">8.2.2</A>). If the value of
this attribute is &quot;4;1&quot; then this exchange structure has
syntactical conformance class 1.  If the value of this attribute is
&quot;4;2&quot; then this exchange structure has syntactical
conformance class 2.  If the value of this attribute is
&quot;4;3&quot; then this exchange structure has syntactical
conformance class 3.</P>

<P>An implementation that claims schema conformance to this part of
ISO 10303 shall read or write files or both that exhibit schema as
well as syntactical conformance.</P>
