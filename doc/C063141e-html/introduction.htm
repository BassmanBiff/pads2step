<H2 CLASS="unum"><A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>

<P>ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the
computer-interpretable representation of product information and for
the exchange of product data.  The objective is to provide a neutral
mechanism capable of describing products throughout their life cycle.
This mechanism is suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but
also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases, and as
a basis for archiving.</P>

<P>This part of ISO 10303 specifies a mechanism that allows product
data described in the EXPRESS language, specified in annex G of ISO
10303-11:2004, to be transferred from one computer system to another.</P>

<P>Major subdivisions in this part of ISO 10303 are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>specification of the exchange structure syntax;</LI>
<LI>mapping from an EXPRESS schema onto this syntax.</LI>
</UL>

<P CLASS="example">
NOTE 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The examples of EXPRESS usage in
this part of ISO 10303 do not conform to any particular style rules.
Indeed, the examples sometimes use poor style to conserve space or to
concentrate on the important points. The examples are not intended to
reflect the content of the information models defined in other parts
of ISO 10303. They are crafted to show particular features of EXPRESS
or of the exchange structure. Many examples are annotated in a way
that is not consistent with the syntax rules of this part of ISO
10303. These annotations are introduced by symbolic arrows, either
horizontal '----&gt;', or vertical.  These annotations can be ignored
when considering the parse rules. Any similarity between the examples
and the normative models specified in other parts of ISO 10303 can be
ignored. Several mapping examples have been provided throughout this
document.  Additional <EM>spaces</EM> and new lines have been inserted
into some of these examples to aid readability.  These <EM>spaces</EM>
and new lines need not appear in an exchange structure.</P>


<P>This edition incorporates the following technical modifications to
ISO 10303-21:2002:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Anchor and reference sections allow entities and values to be
defined in external files;</LI>

<LI>A schema_population controls how a population spans multiple files;</LI>

<LI>The exchange structure can be compressed and stored in an archive;</LI>

<LI>Strings can contain characters as UTF-8 encoded octets instead
of \X2\ and \X4\ control directives;</LI>

<LI>The exchange structure can be given one or more signatures to verify its contents
and validate the credentials of the author;</LI>

<LI>The exchange structure can reference values and instances defined in its EXPRESS schema;</LI>

<LI>The exchange structure can include ECMAScript;</LI>

<LI>The document source has been converted to HTML.</LI>
</UL>

<P CLASS="example">
NOTE 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applications can use the new
edition to enable more data sharing, reduce memory footprint, reduce
development costs, improve performance and increase data security.

<P>All exchange structures that are encoded according to the previous
edition of ISO 10303-21 also conform to this edition. </P>
