<H2 CLASS="annex-clause"><A NAME="clause-L"></A>Annex L<BR>(informative)<BR><BR>Guidelines for printing the exchange structure</H2>


<H3><A NAME="clause-L-1"></A>L.1  Print control directives</H3>

<P>The exchange structure allows the optional inclusion of directives
that explicitly control a printed representation of the
structure. Where such directives are not included but a printed
representation of the exchange structure is to be created, the set of
implicit print control guidelines specified in G.2 should be used. The
explicit print control directives override the implicit print control
guidelines.</P>

<H3><A NAME="clause-L-2"></A>L.2  Explicit print control directives</H3>


<P>Explicit print control directives may be used in those cases where
the sender needs accurate control of the printed appearance of the
exchange structure. </P>

<P>The directive <EM>reverse solidus latin capital letter N reverse
solidus</EM> &quot;&#92;N&#92;&quot; indicates that the first
character immediately following the directive appears at the start of
a new printed line. The directive <EM>reverse solidus latin capital
letter F reverse solidus</EM> &quot;&#92;F&#92;&quot; indicates that
the printing continues at the start of a new page. In either case, the
print control directive itself should not be printed.</P>

<P CLASS="example">
NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The printing of the exchange
structure will normally not be controlled by the explicit or implicit
print control directives. It is assumed that the print control
directives will only be used in those circumstances where the sender
requires control over the printed appearance of the exchange
structure. This situation may occur if the exchange structure is part
of a legal contract.</P>

<H3><A NAME="clause-L-3"></A>L.3  Implicit print control directives</H3>

<P>When printing the exchange structure, the following directives may
be used in the absence of explicit print control directives:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a) printed lines should be left justified;</LI>
<LI>b) each section should begin at the start of a new printed
line;</LI>
<LI>c) header section entities should begin at the start of a new
printed line;</LI>
<LI>d) an instance name preceding the <EM>equals sign</EM>
&quot;=&quot; should begin on a new printed line;</LI>
<LI>e) tokens other than strings and binaries should not be broken
across printed lines. Strings and binaries should be broken only if
they do not fit on a single printed line. Directive h) determines
where strings and binaries should be broken;</LI>
<LI>f) comments should begin on a new printed line;</LI>
<LI>g) a token separator other than a comment should not be broken
across printed lines. A comment will be broken if it does not fit on a
printed line. Directive h) determines where a comment will be
broken;</LI>
<LI>h) printed lines should be at most 72 characters long. If a
character would be printed in the 73rd position of a line, this
character should be printed on the first position of a new printed
line instead.</LI>
