Part 21: Implementation methods:

<H2 CLASS="clause"><A NAME="clause-1"></A>1 Scope</H2>

<P>This part of ISO 10303 specifies an exchange structure format using
a clear text encoding of product data for which the conceptual model
is specified in the EXPRESS language (ISO 10303-11:2004). The exchange
format is suitable for the transfer of product data among computer
systems and for the distribution of product data between several
computer systems.</P>

<P>The mapping from the EXPRESS language described in annex G of ISO
10303-11:2004 to the syntax of the exchange structure is specified. Any
EXPRESS schema can be mapped onto the exchange structure syntax.</P>
