<H2 CLASS="clause"><A NAME="clause-13"></A>13 Printed representation of exchange structures</H2>


<P>The graphic character combinations as specified
in <A HREF=#table-6>Table 6</A> may be used to control the printed
appearance of an exchange structure.  Except as noted below, these
directives may appear at any position where a token separator may
appear, and within strings and binaries.  Details on token separators
are given in <A HREF="clause5.htm#table-3">Table 3</A>. The graphic
character combinations shall appear together without any intervening
graphic characters.</P>

<P>Explicit print control directives are also allowed within
strings. The directives &quot;&#92;N&#92;&quot; and
&quot;&#92;F&#92;&quot; do not contribute to the effective contents of
the string. For the encoding of strings
see <A href="clause6.htm#clause-6-4-3">6.4.3</A>. The print control
directives &quot;&#92;N&#92;&quot; and &quot;&#92;F&#92;&quot; are
relevant only for the printed presentation of the exchange structure
and are to be ignored otherwise. <A HREF="annexG.htm">Annex G</A>
provides guidance on the printing of the exchange structure.  </P>

<P>The directives shall not appear within
UNIVERSAL_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER tokens, within the anchor section
(see <A href="clause9.htm">9</A>), or the reference section
(see <A href="clause10.htm">10</A>).
