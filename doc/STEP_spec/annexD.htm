<P>The Protocol Information and Conformance Statement (PICS) Proforma
supports the conformance assessment of implementations requesting
evaluation to this part of ISO 10303. This annex is in the form of a
questionnaire. This questionnaire is intended to be filled out by the
implementer and may be used in preparation for conformance testing by
a testing laboratory.</P>
